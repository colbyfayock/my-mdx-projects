## Brief

We all live for products whether it’s our mobile phones or the apps we use on our laptops. While there are tons of products in the world, it can be hard to navigate through the good and the bad. Tools like Product Hunt provide a platform to learn about new tools and get reactions and reviews from others.

## Level 1

The most important part about learning about new products is the product itself. We want to know what the product is, what it looks like, and how it works.

Create a page that lets you add a new product to a website with a title, picture,  and description.

## Level 2

When learning about products, reviews are a way we can trust a product before we purchase it. It helps us gain confidence in what we’re about to spend our money or time on.

Add the ability for people to add reviews to each product.

## Level 3

People love products, so there are tons of them in the world. There are way too many to try to sort through manually, so we need a mechanism to search and browse with.

Add the ability to search products and browse by category.
