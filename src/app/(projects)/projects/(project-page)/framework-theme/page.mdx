## Brief

As developers, we commonly have to do a bunch of similar steps any time we create a new project. But tools like themes let us abstract those steps and package it in a easy to use way that can work for any new project.

## Level 1

Gatsby themes are a plugin-like system where we can take advantage of the Gatsby pipeline to share functionality as a package on npm. This opens the door to really doing anything we would do in a Gatsby site, but making it reusable to any Gatsby site.

Create a new Gatsby theme that when used, creates a new a style guide page on any project it’s added to.

## Level 2

The goal of themes isn’t just to create pages, but to add functionality that makes us productive. This includes things like frameworks and project configurations.

Add a CSS framework to the Gatsby theme that lets the project it’s added to use that framework.

## Level 3

Sometimes themes are better only the tools, sometimes it’s helpful to be opinionated. One way to add useful functionality to a CSS framework is to create stock components.

Create resuable React components using the CSS framework that can be used in the project the theme’s added to.
