# Webmentions

Add <strong className="text-brand-blue-medium">webmentions</strong> integration to a website that shows <strong className="text-brand-purple">Twitter interactions</strong> with the website

</ProjectHeader>

<ProjectContent>

## Brief

Social interaction is an impactful way to bring more of an audience and conversation to topics we write about. Having something on a website to show that interaction can be helpful to both inspire people to want to get involved or let people feel like they can be part of it.

## Level 1

In order to make use of Webmentions, a website needs to be configured with meta tags to provide information.

Add the proper meta tags to a website and validate its use with webmention.io.

## Level 2

The Webmentions API is a way to programmatically see connections in social interactions from a URL of your website. It lets you get the type of interaction and even the personâ€™s profile avatar.

Connect a website to Webmentions and add a list of social interactions to blog post pages.

## Level 3

Now that the website is showing all of the interactions, there should be an easy way to join the conversation.

Add a social link that when clicked creates a tweet with a link to the page.
