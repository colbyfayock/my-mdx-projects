## Brief

Dealing with a global pandemic means viruses like the Coronavirus impact the world differently based on geographic location. Having a map with a breakdown of each country’s statistics is a useful way of being able to determine things like which countries were impacted the most.

## Level 1

The easiest way to see statistics country to country is to have a map that you can browse with each country’s statistics  available next to that country.

Create a mapping app that uses the disease.sh Coronavirus API to add markers to the map for each country along with the number of COVID-19 cases.

## Level 2

While having the statistics for each country is helpful, it might be useful to be able to compare those statistics to the number of cases in the entire world.

Add a statistics dashboard that shows the number of COVID-19 cases around the world as well as any other useful statistics from the API.

## Level 3

Getting current statistics is a good way to understand the current state of the world, but how does that compare historically?

Use the historical data API to show graphs on the dashboard that provide context to the growth and spread of the virus.
