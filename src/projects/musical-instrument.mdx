## Brief

Not everyone has the luxury of owning a musical instrument, but maybe those people have a laptop, phone, or tablet. Having a piano is a powerful way to let people play music even if they didn’t have the opportunity before.

## Level 1

Using the browser and web audio APIs, we can create sounds that when put together, can actually sound like music.

Create a set of buttons that play notes of a scale when clicked.

## Level 2

While not everyone’s played an instrument before, the concept and interface of an instrument like a piano is generally more intuitive than a bunch of buttons.

Create a piano layout using buttons that works by either clicking the button or using the physical keyboard.

## Level 3

We might have limited space in the browser, but there’s a wide range of notes, scales, and sounds an electric keyboard might be able to make with some added effects.

Create effect toggles that change the sound of the notes when toggled on.
